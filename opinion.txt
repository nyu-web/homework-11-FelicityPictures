Acquisition vs retention is something I've never thought much about, as I've always had a very macro view of everything. Acquisition focuses on getting the initial users while retention focuses on keeping them. Up until when I decided to focus on UX as a career path, the AARRR framework had been more relevant to me as an aspiring software engineer. The focus had always been on the pitch and the execution was not given much thought, as long as it was standard. As a UX focused person now, however, it seems that RARRA is more important. As the article said, without retention, we're just renting expensive users. Planting and watering a seed is better in the long run.
